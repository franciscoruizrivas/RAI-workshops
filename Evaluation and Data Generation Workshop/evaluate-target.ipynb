       "{'response': 'The capital of India is New Delhi.',\n",
       " 'context': 'Content: Delhi,[b] officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India. Straddling the Yamuna river, but spread chiefly to the west, or beyond its right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and the NCT in 1995.[22] The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573\\xa0sq\\xa0mi).[4] According to the 2011 census, Delhi\\'s city proper population was over 11\\xa0million,[7][23] while the NCT\\'s population was about 16.8\\xa0million.[9]. The topography of the medieval fort Purana Qila on the banks of the river Yamuna matches the literary description of the citadel Indraprastha in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata; however, excavations in the area have revealed no signs of an ancient built environment. From the early 13th century until the mid-19th century, Delhi was the capital of two major empires, the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire, which covered large parts of South Asia. All three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the city, the Qutub Minar, Humayun\\'s Tomb, and the Red Fort, belong to this period. Delhi was the early centre of Sufism and Qawwali music. The names of Nizamuddin Auliya and Amir Khusrau are prominently associated with it. The Khariboli dialect of Delhi was part of a linguistic development that gave rise to the literature of Urdu and later Modern Standard Hindi. Major Urdu poets from Delhi include Mir Taqi Mir and Mirza Ghalib.\\n\\nContent: Capital punishment in India is the highest legal penalty for crimes under the country\\'s main substantive penal legislation, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (formerly Indian Penal Code), as well as other laws. Executions are carried out by hanging as the primary method of execution per Section 354(5) of the Criminal Code of Procedure, 1973 is \"Hanging by the neck until dead\", and is imposed only in the \\'rarest of cases\\'.[1][2]. Currently, there are around 539[3] prisoners on death row in India. The most recent executions in India took place in March 2020, when four of the 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder perpetrators were executed at the Tihar Jail in Delhi.[4]. In the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1898 death was the default punishment for murder and required the concerned judges to give reasons in their judgment if they wanted to give life imprisonment instead.[5] By an amendment to the CrPC in 1955, the requirement of written reasons for not imposing the death penalty was removed, reflecting no legislative preference between the two punishments. In 1973, when the CrPC was amended further, life imprisonment became the norm and the death penalty was to be imposed only in exceptional cases, particularly if a heinous crime committed deems the perpetrator too dangerous to even be \\'considered\\' for paroled release into society after 20 years (life imprisonment without parole does not exist in India since it is too expensive to freely feed and house dangerous criminals all their lives, and eliminating the possibility of parole after a life sentence removes the positive and rehabilitative incentive to improve behaviour; all criminals sentenced to life imprisonment in India are automatically eligible for parole after serving 20 years, as per IPC 57), and required \\'special reasons\\'.[2] This significant change indicated a desire to limit the imposition of the death penalty in India. The CrPC, 1973 also bifurcated a criminal trial into two stages with separate hearings, one for conviction and the other for sentencing.[6]. After the completion of proceedings as prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure, the judge pronounces the judgment in a case under Section 235.[27] In case of conviction of the accused, there shall be a mandatory pre-sentencing hearing as according to Section 235(2),[27] Code of Criminal Procedure. The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, also contains a provision regarding special reason for death sentence. Section 354(3) of the Code provides that the court must record \"Special reasons\" justifying the sentence and state as to why an alternative sentence would not meet the ends of justice in the case, according to the principle \\'Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is the exception\\'.[28].'}"
